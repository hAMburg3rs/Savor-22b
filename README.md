# Savor22b

## Game Overview
Embark on an epic journey through a vast world, creating delicious meals using ingredients grown on your very own farm. Depending on the region you live in, different crops and ingredients will grow. For example, you can plant a pork seed and harvest fresh pork!

By using Life Stones, you can bring your carefully crafted dishes to life. Team up with your superfood companions to explore and conquer various dungeons!

To learn more about our game, check out the [design document](https://github.com/not-blond-beard/Savor22b/wiki/%EA%B8%B0%ED%9A%8D).

### Prototype
We're still in the early stages, constantly iterating and refining the prototype. Once the design is more stable, we plan to develop an MVP. Stay tuned!

## Blockchain
Savor22b is a game built with decentralization in mind. All game data is recorded on the blockchain using [libplanet](https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet), ensuring that anyone can contribute to the development or fork the game. All information within the game is transparently stored on-chain, making it impossible to tamper with.

## Contributions
Although we're still in the prototype phase and havenâ€™t even settled on a final name, all contributions are welcome! Our project will be fully open source.

The repository is structured as a monorepo, with a backend that stores game data on the blockchain and provides it via GQL, and a client that consumes the data and runs the game.

Each project includes a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md for more details, so be sure to check them out!
