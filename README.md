# SAVOR22B

## Introduction
SAVOR22B is a game (prototype) where you explore the world, create food using randomly grown ingredients from your own farm, and make the best superfoods.

## Project
The repository is a monorepo that contains both a backend project, which stores game information on the blockchain and provides data through GQL, and a client project that receives the data and runs the game.  
Each project has its own README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files, so please refer to them for detailed information.

## Transparent Game
SAVOR22B is a decentralized game. Using [libplanet](https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet), all game data is stored on the blockchain, allowing anyone to participate in game development and fork it.  
All in-game information is publicly available as a blockchain and cannot be manipulated, ensuring transparency.
